<h2><a id="A_FOREWORD"></a>A FOREWORD</h2>
<p>When the first Miscellany of American Poetry
appeared in 1920, innumerable were the questions
asked by both readers and reviewers of publishers
and contributors alike. The modest note on the
jacket appeared to satisfy no one. The volume purported
to have no editor, yet a collection without
an editor was pronounced preposterous. It was
obviously not the organ of a school, yet it did not
seem to have been compiled to exploit any particular
phase of American life; neither Nature, Love,
Patriotism, Propaganda, nor Philosophy could be acclaimed
as its reason for being, and it was certainly
not intended, as has been so frequent of late, to bring
a cheerful absence of mind to the world-weary during
an unoccupied ten minutes. Again, it was exclusive
not inclusive, since its object was, evidently,
not the meritorious if impossible one of attempting
to be a compendium of present-day American verse.</p>
<p>But the publisher's note had stated one thing
quite clearly, that the Miscellany was to be a biennial.
Two years have passed, and with the second
volume it has seemed best to state at once the reasons
which actuated its contributors to join in such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>a venture.</p>
<p>In the first place, the plan of the <i>Miscellany</i> is
frankly imitative. For some years now there has
been published in England an anthology entitled
Georgian Poetry. The Miscellany is intended to
be an American companion to that publication. The
dissimilarities of temperament, range and choice of
subjects are manifest, but the outstanding difference
is this: <i>Georgian Poetry</i> has an editor, and the
poems it contains may be taken as that editor's reaction
to the poetry of the day. The <i>Miscellany</i>, on
the other hand, has no editor; it is no one person's
choice which forms it; it is not an attempt to throw
into relief any particular group or stress any particular
tendency. It does disclose the most recent
work of certain representative figures in contemporary
American literature. The poets who appear here
have come together by mutual accord and, although
they may invite others to join them in subsequent
volumes as circumstance dictates, each one stands
(as all newcomers also must stand) as the exponent
of fresh and strikingly diverse qualities in our native
poetry. It is as if a dozen unacademic painters,
separated by temperament and distance, were to arrange
to have an exhibition every two years of their
latest work. They would not pretend that they were
the only painters worthy of a public showing; they
would maintain that their work was, generally speaking,
most interesting to one another. Their gallery
would necessarily be limited; but it would be flexible
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
enough to admit, with every fresh exhibit, three or
four new members who had achieved an importance
and an idiom of their own. This is just what the
original contributors to the <i>Miscellany</i> have done.</p>
<p>The newcomers—H. D., Alfred Kreymborg, and
Edna St. Vincent Millay—have taken their places
with the same absence of judge or jury that marks
any "society of independents." There is no hanging
committee; no organizer of "position." Two
years ago the alphabet determined the arrangement;
this time seniority has been the sole arbiter of precedence.
Furthermore—and this can not be too
often repeated—there has been no editor. To be
painstakingly precise, each contributor has been his
own editor. As such, he has chosen his own selections
and determined the order in which they are to
be printed, but he has had no authority over either
the choice or grouping of his fellow exhibitors' contributions.
To one of the members has been delegated
the merely mechanical labors of assembling,
proof-reading, and seeing the volume through the
press. The absence of E. A. Robinson from this
year's <i>Miscellany</i> is a source of regret not only to
all the contributors but to the poet himself. Mr.
Robinson has written nothing since his Collected
Poems with the exception of a long poem—a volume
in itself—but he hopes to appear in any subsequent
collection.</p>
<p>It should be added that this is not a haphazard
anthology of picked-over poetry. The poems that
follow are new. They are new not only in the sense
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
that (with two exceptions) they cannot be found in
book form, but most of them have never previously
been published. Certain of the selections have appeared
in recent magazines and these are reprinted
by permission of <i>The Century</i>, <i>The Yale Review</i>,
<i>Poetry: A Magazine of Verse</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>,
<i>Harper's</i>, <i>Scribner's</i>, <i>The Bookman</i>, <i>The Freeman</i>,
<i>Broom</i>, <i>The Dial</i>, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Farm and
Fireside</i>, <i>The Measure</i>, and <i>The Literary Review</i>.
Vachel Lindsay's "I Know All This When Gipsy
Fiddles Cry" is a revised version of the poem of
that name which was printed in <i>The Enchanted
Years</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">Color of lilac,</span>
<span class="i0">Your great puffs of flowers</span>
<span class="i0">Are everywhere in this my New England.</span>
<span class="i0">Among your heart-shaped leaves</span>
<span class="i0">Orange orioles hop like music-box birds and sing</span>
<span class="i0">Their little weak soft songs;</span>
<span class="i0">In the crooks of your branches</span>
<span class="i0">The bright eyes of song sparrows sitting on spotted eggs</span>
<span class="i0">Peer restlessly through the light and shadow</span>
<span class="i0">Of all Springs.</span>
<span class="i0">Lilacs in dooryards</span>
<span class="i0">Holding quiet conversations with an early moon;</span>
<span class="i0">Lilacs watching a deserted house</span>
<span class="i0">Settling sideways into the grass of an old road;</span>
<span class="i0">Lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a lopsided shock of bloom</span>
<span class="i0">Above a cellar dug into a hill.</span>
<span class="i0">You are everywhere.</span>
<span class="i0">You were everywhere.</span>
<span class="i0">You tapped the window when the preacher preached his sermon,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_004">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And ran along the road beside the boy going to school.</span>
<span class="i0">You stood by pasture-bars to give the cows good milking,</span>
<span class="i0">You persuaded the housewife that her dish-pan was of silver</span>
<span class="i0">And her husband an image of pure gold.</span>
<span class="i0">You flaunted the fragrance of your blossoms</span>
<span class="i0">Through the wide doors of Custom Houses—</span>
<span class="i0">You, and sandal-wood, and tea,</span>
<span class="i0">Charging the noses of quill-driving clerks</span>
<span class="i0">When a ship was in from China.</span>
<span class="i0">You called to them: "Goose-quill men, goose-quill men,</span>
<span class="i0">May is a month for flitting,"</span>
<span class="i0">Until they writhed on their high stools</span>
<span class="i0">And wrote poetry on their letter-sheets behind the propped-up ledgers.</span>
<span class="i0">Paradoxical New England clerks,</span>
<span class="i0">Writing inventories in ledgers, reading the "Song of Solomon" at night,</span>
<span class="i0">So many verses before bedtime,</span>
<span class="i0">Because it was the Bible.</span>
<span class="i0">The dead fed you</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the slant stones of graveyards.</span>
<span class="i0">Pale ghosts who planted you</span>
<span class="i0">Came in the night time</span>
<span class="i0">And let their thin hair blow through your clustered stems.</span>
<span class="i0">You are of the green sea,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_005">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And of the stone hills which reach a long distance.</span>
<span class="i0">You are of elm-shaded streets with little shops where they sell kites and marbles,</span>
<span class="i0">You are of great parks where every one walks and nobody is at home.</span>
<span class="i0">You cover the blind sides of greenhouses</span>
<span class="i0">And lean over the top to say a hurry-word through the glass</span>
<span class="i0">To your friends, the grapes, inside.</span>

<span class="i0">You have forgotten your Eastern origin,</span>
<span class="i0">The veiled women with eyes like panthers,</span>
<span class="i0">The swollen, aggressive turbans of jeweled Pashas.</span>
<span class="i0">Now you are a very decent flower,</span>
<span class="i0">A reticent flower,</span>
<span class="i0">A curiously clear-cut, candid flower,</span>
<span class="i0">Standing beside clean doorways,</span>
<span class="i0">Friendly to a house-cat and a pair of spectacles,</span>
<span class="i0">Making poetry out of a bit of moonlight</span>
<span class="i0">And a hundred or two sharp blossoms.</span>

<span class="i0">Connecticut takes you from a river to the sea.</span>

<span class="i0">Sweeter than tulips,</span>
<span class="i0">You are the great flood of our souls</span>
<span class="i0">Bursting above the leaf-shapes of our hearts,</span>
<span class="i0">You are the smell of all Summers,</span>
<span class="i0">The love of wives and children,</span>
<span class="i0">The recollection of the gardens of little children,</span>
<span class="i0">You are State Houses and Charters</span>
<span class="i0">And the familiar treading of the foot to and fro on a road it knows.</span>
<span class="i0">May is lilac here in New England,</span>
<span class="i0">May is a thrush singing "Sun up!" on a tip-top ash-tree,</span>
<span class="i0">May is white clouds behind pine-trees</span>
<span class="i0">Puffed out and marching upon a blue sky.</span>
<span class="i0">May is a green as no other,</span>
<span class="i0">May is much sun through small leaves,</span>
<span class="i0">May is soft earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And apple-blossoms,</span>
<span class="i0">And windows open to a South wind.</span>
<span class="i0">May is a full light wind of lilac</span>
<span class="i0">From Canada to Narragansett Bay.</span>

<span class="i0">What evidently nothing could conclude.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The thing that made me more and more afraid</span>

<span class="i0">And when he raised it dripping once and tried</span>
<span class="i0">The creepy edge of it with wary touch,</span>
<span class="i0">And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed,</span>
<span class="i0">Only disinterestedly to decide</span>
<span class="i0">It needed a turn more, I could have cried</span>
<span class="i0">Wasn't there danger of a turn too much?</span>
<span class="i0">Mightn't we make it worse instead of better?</span>

<span class="i1">When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom</span>
<span class="i1">And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.</span>
<span class="i1">The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on</span>
<span class="i1">When there was water in the cellar in spring</span>
<span class="i1">Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then some one</span>
<span class="i1">Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,</span>
<span class="i1">The way a man with one leg and a crutch,</span>
<span class="i1">Or little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile:</span>
<span class="i1">It wasn't any one who could be there.</span>
<span class="i1">The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_032">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i1">And swollen tight and buried under snow.</span>
<span class="i1">The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust</span>
<span class="i1">And swollen tight and buried under snow.</span>
<span class="i1">It was the bones. I knew them—and good reason.</span>
<span class="i1">My first impulse was to get to the knob</span>
<span class="i1">And hold the door. But the bones didn't try</span>
<span class="i1">The door; they halted helpless on the landing,</span>
<span class="i1">Waiting for things to happen in their favor.</span>
<span class="i1">The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.</span>
<span class="i1">I never could have done the thing I did</span>
<span class="i1">If the wish hadn't been too strong in me</span>
<span class="i1">To see how they were mounted for this walk.</span>
<span class="i1">I had a vision of them put together</span>
<span class="i1">Not like a man, but like a chandelier.</span>
<span class="i1">So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.</span>
<span class="i1">A moment he stood balancing with emotion,</span>
<span class="i1">And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire</span>
<span class="i1">Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.</span>
<span class="i1">Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)</span>
<span class="i1">Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,</span>
<span class="i1">The way he did in life once; but this time</span>
<span class="i1">I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,</span>
<span class="i1">And fell back from him on the floor myself.</span>
<span class="i1">The finger-pieces slid in all directions.</span>
<span class="i1">(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_033">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Hand me my button-box—it must be there.)</span>
<span class="i1">I sat up on the floor and shouted, "Toffile,</span>
<span class="i1">It's coming up to you." It had its choice</span>
<span class="i1">Of the door to the cellar or the hall.</span>
<span class="i1">It took the hall door for the novelty,</span>
<span class="i1">And set off briskly for so slow a thing,</span>
<span class="i1">Still going every which way in the joints, though,</span>
<span class="i1">So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,</span>
<span class="i1">From the slap I had just now given its hand.</span>
<span class="i1">I listened till it almost climbed the stairs</span>
<span class="i1">From the hall to the only finished bedroom,</span>
<span class="i1">Before I got up to do anything;</span>
<span class="i1">Then ran and shouted, "Shut the bedroom door,</span>
<span class="i1">Toffile, for my sake!" "Company," he said,</span>
<span class="i1">"Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed."</span>
<span class="i1">So lying forward weakly on the handrail</span>
<span class="i1">I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light</span>
<span class="i1">(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own</span>
<span class="i1">I could see nothing. "Toffile, I don't see it.</span>
<span class="i1">It's with us in the room, though. It's the bones."</span>
<span class="i1">"What bones?" "The cellar bones—out of the grave."</span>
</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i1">That made him throw his bare legs out of bed</span>
<span class="i1">And sit up by me and take hold of me.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_034">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i1">I wanted to put out the light and see</span>
<span class="i1">If I could see it, or else mow the room,</span>
<span class="i1">With our arms at the level of our knees,</span>
<span class="i1">And bring the chalk-pile down. "I'll tell you what—</span>
<span class="i1">It's looking for another door to try.</span>
<span class="i1">The uncommonly deep snow has made him think</span>
<span class="i1">Of his old song, <i>The Wild Colonial Boy</i>,</span>
<span class="i1">He always used to sing along the tote-road.</span>
<span class="i1">He's after an open door to get out-doors.</span>
<span class="i1">Let's trap him with an open door up attic."</span>
<span class="i1">Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,</span>
<span class="i1">Almost the moment he was given an opening,</span>
<span class="i1">The steps began to climb the attic stairs.</span>
<span class="i1">I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them.</span>
<span class="i1">"Quick!" I slammed to the door and held the knob.</span>
<span class="i1">"Toffile, get nails." I made him nail the door shut,</span>
<span class="i1">And push the headboard of the bed against it.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then we asked was there anything</span>
<span class="i1">Up attic that we'd ever want again.</span>
<span class="i1">The attic was less to us than the cellar.</span>
<span class="i1">If the bones liked the attic, let them like it,</span>
<span class="i1">Let them <i>stay</i> in the attic. When they sometimes</span>
<span class="i1">Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_035">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Behind the door and headboard of the bed,</span>
<span class="i1">Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,</span>
<span class="i1">With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,</span>
<span class="i1">That's what I sit up in the dark to say—</span>
<span class="i1">To no one any more since Toffile died.</span>
<span class="i1">Let them stay in the attic since they went there.</span>
<span class="i1">I promised Toffile to be cruel to them</span>
<span class="i1">For helping them be cruel once to him.</span>

<div>
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.
</div><div>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div id="project-gutenberg-license">START: FULL LICENSE</div>

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
